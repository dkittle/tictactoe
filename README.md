# Tic Tac Toe Backend

## Background

This is a programming exercise that I pair with developers on to see how they work toward a solution and how they take feedback.

## How the exercise was run

Regardless of whether they have done TDD or no, we always started with tests.  From there we evolve a solution until it works and all parties are happy with it.

We always started by with the initial requirement - a method to tell if the game was won or not.  All candidates would start with a method that returned a Boolean.  Once there was a solution, we'd refine by asking them to refactor so that the method returns who won the game.

## The Exercise

This programming exercise involves creating a backend to manage a game of Tic Tac Toe.

The code should (eventually) allow moves and allow a frontend client to determine the current player and know when a game is won (and who won it).

As ever, there should be tests :)
